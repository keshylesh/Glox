# Glox: A Lox interpreter implemented in Go
A tree-walking [Lox](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) interpreter implemented in Go using [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) as reference

## Usage

```shell
./glox <path/to/file>
```
Running glox without a file will begin an interactive prompt/repl where code can be ran line by line. Adding a file as an argument will use the file as input.

Run ```make``` to generate the executable.
